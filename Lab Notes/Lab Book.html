<p>The complete repository can be found on Github. I made this repo public for the purpose of sharing it with you, it does not contain any sensitive or confidential materials. The repo can be found at https://github.com/CheffySins/NMI-Placement-2024.</p>
<p>This lab book is dated 13 October, and the labbook accessed on github may have been updated since the time of you opening this (can be found in /Lab Notes/ Lab Book.md). The main reason I'm sharing this, is so that you have quick direct access to the references if you need them, as well as to the photos and handwritten notes I took throughout my placement, as not all of them have since made their way to this digital notebook.</p>
<p>From speaking to my supervisor (Mar-Dean), it will be beneficial to her (and NMI), if I also submit this lab book in its final form at the end of Week 13 alongside the project report, as she'll then use it as a stepping stone for improving traceability with the AF4 measurements and data analysis, and therefore, this labbook has been laid out with that in mind (hence some of the missing photos, which are still there for your reference and my grades). I'm happy to come in and discuss any of the above with you if required, as I'd be able to better explain what I'm trying to get across 😃</p>

<p><strong>Project Title:</strong> Developing Software for Data Processing from Field-Flow Fractionation (FFF) / Asymmetric Flow Field-Flow Fractionation (AF4)</p>
<p><strong>Project Description:</strong> This project involves developing software to process data from a Field-Flow Fractionation (FFF) instrument, which is used to derive the size distributions of particles in liquid suspensions. This coding-intensive project requires experience with Python or a similar programming language to effectively analyse, clean, and visualise experimental data.</p>
<p>The team at NMI currently use Astra8 Software to do data analysis using their AF4 machine. This software acts as a kind of 'black box', in that obtaining fundamental proof of the algorithms / code used to do data treatment is either extremely difficult to obtain, or not possible (realistically). Additionally, the reports generated by Astra often contain too much non-useful information.</p>
<p>Traceability is a foundational cornerstone of nanometrology (and metrology in general), and so, I've been tasked with creating an open source template that will do the required data treatment, while also giving greater flexibility to displaying only the data that is required for a specific kind of experiment or sequence.</p>
<p>The order of treatments done by the team currently using Astra is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Despiking</li>
<li>Baseline Selection</li>
<li>Peak Definitions</li>

<li>Distribution Analysis</li>
</ol>
<p>My goal is to write code that will do each of the above, both in that order, and individually. Once I've got together all of the equations and procedures required, I will transfer the code to Stata (provided by MQ), and then port into OriginLabs, which is the software that NMI staff have access to.</p>

<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p>This lab book documents the development of a Python-based data processing software for the Field-Flow Fractionation (FFF) instrument utilised by the Nanometrology team at the National Measurement Institute (NMI). The FFF instrument is critical for deriving particle size distributions in liquid suspensions, an important aspect in nanoparticle characterisation. The focus of this placement was on Asymmetric Flow Field-Flow Fractionation (AF4), a specialised form of FFF. The software automates data processing tasks such as despiking, baseline correction, peak detection, and calculation of hydrodynamic radius. Calculating molar mass may be too difficult without an RI detector, and I have not done that yet but will attempt to if I have the capacity at the end. Preliminary results indicate significant improvements in efficiency and repeatability, enhancing NMI's capabilities in nanometrology by improving measurement accuracy and reducing manual workload.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Field-Flow Fractionation (FFF) is a widely used technique in nanometrology for separating and analysing particles based on size, shape, and density. The technique is highly effective for characterising nanoparticles in liquid suspensions, providing detailed insights into critical properties such as particle size distribution. Accurate measurements are essential for research in fields such as material science, biotechnology, and pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>At NMI, the Nanometrology team employs FFF instruments to support research and provide services for nanoparticle characterisation. However, the raw data generated by these instruments requires extensive manual processing, which is both labour-intensive and prone to inconsistencies. This project aims to automate the data processing pipeline using Python to enhance accuracy, repeatability, and efficiency, ultimately adding value to NMI’s capabilities by reducing human error and standardising data analysis.</p>
<p>The specific focus of this project was on Asymmetric Flow Field-Flow Fractionation (AF4), a variant of FFF that uses a unique channel design to separate particles based on size. AF4 is particularly suited for analysing a wide range of particle sizes, from proteins to larger nanoparticles, making it a powerful tool in the field of nanometrology.</p>
<h2 id="project-plan">Project Plan</h2>
<h3 id="aims-and-objectives">Aims and Objectives</h3>
<p>The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust software solution for processing data generated by the AF4 instrument, enabling accurate determination of particle size distributions in liquid suspensions. The specific objectives include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing Python-based software for data handling, including despiking, peak selection, baseline correction, and size distribution analysis.</li>
<li>Automating key data processing tasks to reduce manual workload and standardise procedures.</li>
<li>Enhancing the efficiency and repeatability of AF4 data analysis.</li>

<h3 id="field-flow-fractionation-fff-overview">Field-Flow Fractionation (FFF) Overview</h3>
<p>Field-Flow Fractionation (FFF) is a technique that allows the separation, or fractionation, of particles and macromolecules based on differences in their size, shape, and density. Fractionation in this context refers to the process of separating components of a mixture so that particles of similar properties are grouped together. In FFF, a field is applied perpendicular to the direction of flow, creating a velocity gradient that enables the differentiation of particles.</p>
<p>Field-Flow Fractionation (FFF) is a separation technique that allows the fractionation of particles and macromolecules based on differences in their hydrodynamic sizes. It works by applying a perpendicular field that forces particles towards the accumulation wall, creating a velocity gradient across the channel.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Types of FFF:</strong> Sedimentation, Thermal, Flow, Centrifugal and Electrical FFF.</li>
<li><strong>FFF Instrument Components:</strong> Channel, flow pump, detector (e.g., Light Scattering, UV Absorbance).</li>
<li><strong>Applications:</strong> Protein aggregation analysis, nanoparticle characterisation, and colloid stability studies.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="asymmetric-flow-field-flow-fractionation-af4">Asymmetric Flow Field-Flow Fractionation (AF4)</h3>
<p>Asymmetric Flow Field-Flow Fractionation (AF4) is a specific type of FFF that utilises an asymmetric channel, where only one wall allows cross-flow. This asymmetry creates a parabolic flow profile that enables highly efficient size-based separation of particles. AF4 is particularly useful for separating and analysing a wide range of particle sizes, from proteins and polymers to larger nanoparticles.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AF4 Channel Design:</strong> AF4 uses a semi-permeable membrane on one side of the channel, which allows the cross-flow to drive smaller particles closer to the accumulation wall while larger particles remain in faster-moving regions.</li>
<li><strong>Applications:</strong> AF4 is ideal for nanoparticle characterisation, protein aggregation studies, and the analysis of complex colloidal systems.</li>

<p>This law is fundamental in UV-Vis spectroscopy for quantifying the concentration of analytes in solution. It assumes that the absorbance is directly proportional to both the concentration of the substancnce and the path length. This linear relationship is valid for dilute solutions, where deviations due to high concentrations or chemical interactions are minimal. Typically, this law holds up to concentrations around <strong>0.01 M</strong>, where beyond this limit, deviations occur due to:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><strong>High concentration effects</strong>, where the solute molecules may interact or aggregate, changing their absorbance characteristics.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nonlinear absorption</strong>, the absorption of light may saturate at higher concentrations, especially in cases where self-absorption or re-emission occurs.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The exact concentration threshold depends on the chemical nature of the substance and the specific experimental conditions, but generally, it is best to keep concentrations under 0.01 M to maintain linearity in the Beer-Lambert law for accurate measurements.</p>

<p>In DLS, the diffusion coefficient (often referred to as the <strong>translational self-diffusion coefficient</strong>) specifically describes the movement of individual particles in a homogenous solution, independent of concentration gradients or external forces.

<dt><strong>Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and Multi-Angle Light Scattering (MALS)</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and Multi-Angle Light Scattering (MALS) are two light scattering techniques widely used in particle and molecular characterisation.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>DLS, also known as <strong>quasi-elastic light scattering (QELS)</strong>, measures the time-dependent fluctuations in scattered light intensity caused by the Brownian motion of particles in suspension. By analysing these fluctuations, DLS calculates the diffusion coefficient and, subsequently, the hydrodynamic radius of particles. This technique is especially useful for determining particle sizes in the nanometer range, such as proteins polymers, and nanoparticles.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>MALS measures the angular dependence of scattered light to determine the <strong>molecular weight</strong> and <strong>radius of gyration</strong> of macromolecules in solution. Unlike DLS, which is limited to particle size, MALS can characterise a wider range of macromolecular properties, including shape, structure, and conformation, making it essential in fields like polymer science and biophysics.</li>

<p>Descibes the scattering of electromagnetic waves by spherical particles, applicable when the particle diameter is comparable to the wavelength of the incident light. Developed by Gustav Mie, the theory is an extension of Rayleigh scattering to larger particles. Mie theory provides the framework to calculate scattering intensity as a function of the particle size, refractive index, and wavelength of the incident light, and is essential for interpreting light scattering from particles such as aerosols, cells, and other systems. The theory has applications in fields like medical imaging, material science and atmospheric science.</p>

<p>Osmotic pressure is the pressure required to prevent the flow of a solvent into a solution through a semipermeable membrane. It arises when a solvent moves from a region of lower solute concentration (pure solvent) to a region of higher solute concentration (solution) to equalise concentrations on both sides of the membrane. This flow is driven by osmotic forces, which are rooted in the tendency of systems to reach equilibrium.</p>

<dt><strong>Spectroscopy</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and matter. It is a cornerstone tool in analytical chemistry and physics for determining the composition, structure and properties of materials. By analysing how different wavelengths of light are absorved, emitted or scattered by a substance, scientists can infer information about its molecular makeup and behaviour. Spectroscopic techniques are applied across various regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, including ultraviolet (UV), visible (Vis), infrared (IR), and X-ray, each showcasing novel insights depending on the sample and the properties being investigated.</p>

<p>This equation is foundational in Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) as it allows for the determination of particle size based on diffusion measurements. The equation assumes that the particles are spherical and are diffusing through a medium under Brownian motion. The Stokes-Einstein equation gives crucial insights into the relationship between a particle's size, termperature, and the fluid's viscosity, enabling researchers to characterise nanoparticles, proteins, and other colloidal systems.</p>

<dt><strong>UV-Vis Spectroscopy</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>UV-Vis spectroscopy is a type of absorption spectroscopy that focuses on the ultraviolet and visible regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. It measures how much UV or visible light a sample absorbs, often providing information about the electronic transitions in molecules. This technique is commonly used for determining the concentration of solutions through the Beer-Lambert law, which relates the absorbance of light to the properties of the material. UV-Vis spectroscopy is invaluable for analysing compounds with conjugated electron systems, such as organic molecules and biomolecules, and is widely used in fields like biochemistry, environmental science, and pharmacology.</p>

<dt><strong>Zimm Theory</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Zimm theory, often used in conjuction with static light scattering, describes the molecular weight, size, and shape of polymers in solution. The theory, developed by Bruno Zimm, includes a model that accounts for inter-molecular interactions and uses the concept of the <strong>Zimm plot</strong>, which plots the inverse of scattered light intensity against the scattering angle. The slope and intercept of the Zimm plot provide important parameters such as the <strong>molecular weight, radius of gyration</strong>, and <strong>second virial coefficient</strong>. Zimm modelling helps to understand polymer structure and dynamics, making it a fundamental tool in polymer chemistry and biochemistry.</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Elution</strong></td>
<td>In FFF, elution refers to the process where separated particles exit the channel. Smaller particles typically elute later due to slower diffusion rates in AF4 systems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Focus</strong></td>
<td>A step where the sample is concentrated at a specific point in the channel by applying flows from opposite directions, positioning the particles before separation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Focus Inject</strong></td>
<td>A combined step where the sample is injected and simultaneously focused. The sample is introduced into the channel and pushed to the focus area, preparing it for separation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Elution Inject</strong></td>
<td>Involves injecting the sample into the channel specifically for the elution phase. It follows the focus phase and marks the start of particle separation and elution.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Cross Flow</strong></td>
<td>In AF4, cross flow is a perpendicular flow applied across the channel width. It pushes particles toward the channel walls, creating a size-based separation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Channel Flow</strong></td>
<td>The main flow that moves the sample down the length of the channel toward the outlet, carrying particles through the channel for separation by cross flow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Outlet Flow</strong></td>
<td>The final flow that directs particles out of the channel after separation. Particle properties, such as size and shape, affect the time taken to reach the outlet.</td>

<ul>
<li><strong>Time Data:</strong> Represents elapsed time during the fractionation process.</li>
<li><strong>Raw Light Scattering Data:</strong> Unprossessed measusrement of scattered light intensity detected during a DLS / MALS experiment. Represents intensity of light scattered by particles as a function of time.</li>
<li><strong>UV Absorbance Data:</strong> Measurement of the amount of UV light absorbed by a sample over a range of wavelengths. Useful for concentration analysing structural properties of the particles.</li>
<li><strong>Count rate:</strong> A measure of the frequency of detected photon events. Represents the number of photons scattered by the particles and detected by the photodetector per second. The count rate is directly related to the intensity of scattered light.
<ul>
<li>A higher count rate generally indicates larger particles or higher concentrations as more photons are scattered (meaning increased LS intensity).</li>
<li>Stable count rate suggests consistent scattering and uniform particle distribution, whereas a fluctuating one may mean aggregation or the presence of impurities.</li>

<p>I have used the following libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>pandas</strong> for data manipulation and analysis, particularly with data structures like datafranes, which are great for handling tabular data.</li>
<li><strong>numpy</strong> for numerical computations in Python, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.</li>
<li><strong>matplotlib.pyplot</strong>, which is a plotting library used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualisations in Python, particularly for 2D plots and graphs.</li>
<li><strong>scipy.signal.medfilt</strong>, a function within the SciPy library’s signal processing module, used for applying a median filter to a signal, which is helpful in reducing noise in data.</li>

<h4 id="despiking-algorithm">Despiking Algorithm</h4>
<p>Despiking is the process of identifying and removing extreme deviations (spikes) in data. Spikes in data are typically due to noise or external anomalies and do not represent the underlying signal. Example can be seen in the raw data plots in the Practical Notebook. There are three different despiking algorithms that I investigated and tested;</p>

<p>Interpretation:</p>
<ul>
<li>A z-score of 0 means the data point is exactly at the mean.</li>
<li>A positive z-score indicates the data point is above the mean.</li>
<li>A negative z-score indicates the data point is below the mean.</li>
<li>For example, a z-score of 2 means the data point is 2 standard deviations above the mean, while a z-score of -1.5 means it is 1.5 standard deviations below the mean.</li>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Rolling Mean</strong></td>
<td>A technique where each data point in a time series is replaced by the average of the neighbouring points within a defined window. This method smooths the data by reducing the impact of random noise and spikes.</td>
<td>Useful when the goal is to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends or cycles in the data. It’s commonly used in any context where gradual trends are more important than short-lived variations.</td>
<td>While Rolling mean is useful for identifying overall trends, it can smooth out significant but brief variations (potentially losing important data features). Additionally, rolling mean is not very reliable at boundaries due to fewer points being available.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Z-Score</strong></td>
<td>Involves calculating the standard score (Z-score) of each data point, which measures how many standard deviations a point is from the mean. Data points with Z-scores exceeding a certain threshold are considered outliers or spikes and can be replaced or removed.</td>
<td>best suited for situations where outliers are expected to be rare and significantly different from the rest of the data, such as in sensor readings or quality control processes. It’s also useful when the data is approximately normally distributed.</td>
<td>Useful for identifying significant outliers, it assumes that the data is normally distributed, which is not always the case.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Median Filter</strong></td>
<td>A median filter replaces each data point with the median of its neighbours within a specified window. Unlike the rolling mean, the median filter is robust to outliers because the median is less affected by extreme values.</td>
<td>Effective in applications where spikes are frequent but not indicative of true data trends, such as in image processing, environmental sensor data, or any scenario where random, sharp noise needs to be removed without distorting the underlying signal.</td>
<td>Particularly useful to preserve sharp features / edges within the data.</td>

<h3 id="data-comparisons-and-cross-validation">Data Comparisons and Cross-Validation</h3>
<p><strong>30 August 2024</strong></p>
<p>Assisted MD with comparing Polystyrene Latex (PSL) in SDS data across the two machines. The data for the 100nm particles is much nicer than the 20nm data when looking at the UV absorption data, illustrated in Lab Notes 2 PDF<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The primary issue identified is that the UV plots follow a different pattern / have a different shape to the DLS data.</p>
<p>Potential solutions to this issue were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trying to emulate tested BSA method for use with PSL. Since BSA is ~5nm, it 'should' work on larger particles.</li>
<li>Looking through the Wyatt handbook for 50nm particles and copying their methods to check if that works</li>
</ul>
<p>The Wyatt handbook for PSL with long channel (what NMI has) had the following method:</p>

<h3 id="coffee-riffing-experiment">Coffee Riffing Experiment</h3>
<p><strong>Aim</strong></p>
<p>We want to get a true representation of a bulk sample, removing bias that is added during things steps such as transport (e.g. truck driving the sample, which vibrates the sample and causes coffee to be dispersed by size).</p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Label everything</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weigh the coffee</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weigh the jars</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Line up the jars with riffler and attach all 8</p>
<ul>
<li>Riffler before jar attachments</li>
</ul>

 - Riffler after attaching the jarks
 <img src="./Photos/Lab Work/20240830 Coffee - Separation.jpg" alt="Coffee Riffing 2" />
</li>
<li>
<p>Add sample by the spoonful to the funnel<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Coffee splits over the channel due to vibrations and travels along it into the spinning funnel, separating into 1 of 8 jars. The idea is, by spinning, the jars collect more even distributions of the coffee particles that are bouncing along the channel.</p>
<p>Sometimes, coffee builds up after going into the separator (before entering jars), potentially due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coffee heats up (from channel), or</li>
<li>Adding the coffee too fast, causing it to clump.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brush any remaining sample into channel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Turn off the machine after all possible sample is riffled</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove jars from rotator</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weigh full jars</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pour into plastic jars</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose 1 sample to split into a further 8 vials</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeat experiment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add to small vials</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weight vials</p>
