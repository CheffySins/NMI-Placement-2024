### Overview of Asymmetric Flow Field-Flow Fractionation (AF4)

**Asymmetric Flow Field-Flow Fractionation (AF4)** is a powerful technique used for the separation and characterisation of macromolecules and nanoparticles. It is particularly useful in the field of nanotechnology and polymer science due to its gentle separation conditions and ability to work with a broad size range of particles. The fundamental principle of AF4 is the separation of particles based on their diffusion coefficients in a flow channel. A cross-flow field perpendicular to the direction of the channel flow forces particles of different sizes to different positions within the parabolic flow profile, leading to their separation. Larger particles, with lower diffusion coefficients, are pushed closer to the channel walls and elute later than smaller particles.

### Explanation of Parameters

1. **Hydrodynamic Radius (Rh) / Hydrodynamic Diameter (dh)**
   - **Hydrodynamic Radius (Rh)** is a measure of how a particle diffuses in a fluid and is defined using the Stokes-Einstein equation:
     $$
     Rh = \frac{k_B T}{6 \pi \eta D}
     $$
     where $ k_B $ is the Boltzmann constant, $ T $ is the absolute temperature, $ \eta $ is the viscosity of the medium, and $ D $ is the diffusion coefficient.
   - **Hydrodynamic Diameter (dh)** is simply twice the hydrodynamic radius ($ dh = 2 \times Rh $).

2. **Radius of Gyration (Rg)**
   - **Radius of Gyration (Rg)** is a measure of the distribution of a particleâ€™s mass around its center of mass. For larger molecules (>10 nm), it can be determined using multi-angle light scattering (MALS). The relation for Rg in terms of molecular weight $ M $ and the scattering intensity $ I $ is:
     $$
     Rg^2 = \frac{I(q)}{q^2}
     $$
     where $ q $ is the scattering vector.

3. **Recovery % (from UV data)**
   - **Recovery %** is used to quantify the amount of sample that has been successfully eluted and detected. It is calculated using:
     $$
     \text{Recovery \%} = \left( \frac{\text{Amount detected}}{\text{Initial amount}} \right) \times 100
     $$

4. **Burchard Stockmayer Shape Factor**
   - This factor relates the radius of gyration to the hydrodynamic radius and provides insight into the shape of the macromolecule:
     $$
     \text{Shape Factor} = \frac{Rg}{Rh}
     $$
